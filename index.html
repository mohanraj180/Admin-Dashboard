                <h4>
                    A tribute page is a website that you can create to honor someone you admire. You can include a
                    biography of
                    the person, photos, and videos, as well as your own thoughts and memories about them.

                <h4>Survey Form</h4>
                <h4>
                    A survey form is a great way to collect feedback from your users. You can use it to ask them
                    questions about
                    their experience with your website or product.
                </h4>
                <h4>Technical Documentation Page</h4>
                <h4>
                    If you create any technical documentation, such as a user manual or API reference, you can create a
                    website
                    to host it. This will make it easy for your users to find and access the documentation.
                </h4>
                <h4>Landing Page</h4>
                <h4>
                    A landing page is a standalone web page that is designed to promote a specific product or service.
                    It
                    typically includes a call to action, such as a button that prompts the user to sign up for a free
                    trial or
                    purchase a product.
                </h4>
                <h4>Event Page</h4>
                <h4>
                    If you are hosting an event, you can create a website to promote it. This will help you to reach a
                    wider
                    audience and generate excitement for your event.
                </h4>
                <h4>Parallax Website</h4>
                <h4>
                    A parallax website is a type of website that uses different background images that move at different
                    speeds
                    as the user scrolls down the page. This creates a 3D effect that can be very eye-catching.
